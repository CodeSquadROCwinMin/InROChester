        <h3>Answer Key</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>C.</b> From flour mills to flower nurseries, we've done it all. Bonus if you also knew about <i>The Young Lion of the West</i>!</li>
            <li><b>A.</b> All of these restaurants are legendary in the area, but <mark>Nick Tahou Hots</mark> came up with this culinary hodgepodge for the college crowd more than 50 years ago, trademarking the name of the dish in 1992.</li>
            <li><b>A.</b> This <i>does</i> exist in Virginia City, Nevada, but is not at all affiliated with Rochester.</li>
            <li><b>B.</b> Malik Evans is the mayor of Rochester, NY, as of January 1, 2022.</li>
            <li><b>F.</b> Tyler James Williams is the only actor on this list not from Rochester; however, Vincent Martella, his co-star on <i>Everybody Hates Chris</i>, was born here!</li>
            <li><b>C.</b> All the rest of these films were shot in and around Rochester, NY!</li>
            <li><b>H.</b> You knew this was a "gimme" question, I'm sure. Rochester has attracted big businesses from far and wide since its inception.

            <li><b>False.</b> Trick question! This existed once upon a time not too long ago, but alas, was fairly short-lived. Luckily, Toronto remains a three-hour drive away. Want a halfway stop? Consider checking out Buffalo or Niagara Falls!</li>
